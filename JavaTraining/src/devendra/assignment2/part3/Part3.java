	 Create a class with a constructor that takes a String argument.

	 Create an array of object references to this class,

	 When you run the program, notice whether the initialization messages from the constructor calls are printed.

// When you run the program, notice whether the initialization messages from the constructor calls are printed.

// It is not printed.

// if we do Part3 [] array=new Part3[10]; then no objects are created except your array, 
// each field will be null until you initialize it. 
// Above only create place to store reference of Part3 Class object. 
// Although Array array is created but its not referencing any object and we can't do like array[i].someMethod().

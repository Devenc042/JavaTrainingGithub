In English football, "The Invincibles" has been used to refer to the Preston North End team of the 1880s managed by William Sudell,[1][2] and the Arsenal team of the 2003–04 season managed by Arsène Wenger.[3] Preston earned the nickname after completing an entire season undefeated in league and cup competition, while Arsenal were undefeated in the league.

In Scotland, Celtic (in 1897–98) and Rangers (in 1898–99) went undefeated in the league, with Rangers winning all 18 of their league fixtures for a perfect season.[4] More recently, the Celtic side managed by Brendan Rodgers went unbeaten across domestic league and cup competition during the 2016–17 season.[5]

In Italy, the Milan side that won the 1991–92 Serie A title undefeated has also been labelled the "Invincibles".[6]
